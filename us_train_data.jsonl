FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Beginning in 2009, the Obama administration instituted \n        a policy to release the visitor access records for the White \n        House complex.\n            (2) This policy was responsible for making public the names \n        of nearly 6,000,000 visitors to the White House in the 8 years \n        of the Obama administration.\n            (3) This policy provided the people of the United States \n        with insight into who influences the White House and \n        transparency regarding efforts by lobbyists to effect policies, \n        legislation, and Presidential actions.\n            (4) To date, the Trump administration has not indicated \n        whether it will continue the policy of publicly releasing White \n        House visitor access records.\n            (5) Since taking office on January 20, 2017, President \n        Trump has conducted official business not only in the White \n        House, but also at several of his privately owned clubs and \n        resorts.\n            (6) President Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, \n        Florida, has been dubbed the ``Winter White House'' and the \n        ``Southern White House''.\n            (7) President Trump has spent 5 of his first 9 weekends in \n        office at Mar-a-Lago.\n            (8) Mar-a-Lago is a private membership facility open to \n        members, their guests, and others who have been invited as \n        guests for special events.\n            (9) Visitors to Mar-a-Lago do not undergo the same \n        background checks as White House visitors and visitor access \n        records to the club have not been released to the public.\n            (10) The President has conducted official business and \n        hosted international leaders at Mar-a-Lago.\n            (11) Media reports have shown President Trump and members \n        of his Cabinet at Mar-a-Lago and nearby Trump International \n        Golf Club interacting with members and guests, providing access \n        unavailable to the general public.\n            (12) President Trump owns many other properties that offer \n        similar amenities and membership-only access where he is likely \n        to conduct official business during his term in office.\n            (13) On March 11, 2017, President Trump hosted several \n        members of his Cabinet at his Trump National Golf Club in \n        Potomac Falls, Virginia, to discuss homeland security, health \n        care, and the economy according to media reports.\n            (14) Media reports have indicated that the President may \n        use his Bedminster, New Jersey, resort as a ``Summer White \n        House''.\n            (15) The people of the United States expect and deserve \n        transparency in government. The policy to release visitor \n        access records instituted by the previous administration \n        appropriately balanced transparency with the need for \n        confidentiality in government actions.\n            (16) To the extent Mar-a-Lago and any other private \n        facilities become locations where the President conducts \n        business and interacts with individuals who are not government \n        officials, the same disclosures should apply.\n\nSEC. 3.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n            (1) The Environmental Protection Agency (``EPA'') was \n        required by the terms of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 \n        and a 1998 consent agreement to determine whether regulation of \n        mercury from electric utility steam generating units under \n        section 112 of the Clean Air Act was appropriate and necessary.\n            (2) In a December 2000, regulatory finding, the EPA \n        concluded that regulation of mercury from electric utility \n        steam generating units was appropriate and necessary.\n            (3) In 2005, the EPA withdrew its 2000 regulatory finding \n        in favor of a national cap-and-trade system for mercury \n        emissions from electric utility steam generating units, the \n        Clean Air Mercury Rule (``CAMR'').\n            (4) CAMR was subsequently challenged in petitions for \n        review filed by 17 States.\n            (5) The United States Court of Appeals for the District of \n        Columbia Circuit vacated the rule on February 8, 2008, finding \n        that once the EPA had listed electric utility steam generating \n        units as a source of hazardous air pollutants, it was required \n        by law to proceed with Maximum Achievable Control Technology \n        (``MACT'') regulations under section 112 of the Clean Air Act \n        unless it delisted the source category, under procedures set \n        forth in section 112(c)(9).\n            (6) Mercury control technologies for coal-fired electric \n        utility steam generating units have advanced rapidly in the \n        last few years.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to protect public health \nand welfare, and the environment, through mercury emission reductions \nfrom electric utility steam generating units.\n\nSEC. 3.

And (2) 90 capture of inlet mercury or an emission rate of 0.8 pounds of mercury per trillion Btu of input coal by 2015 and each year thereafter. Specifies methods that owners or operators of affected units are required to use as reference methods in calibrating the instruments used to measure the mercury concentrations in emissions from affected units. Establishes excess emissions penalties for mercury. Sets forth compliance provisions. Authorizes: (1) owners or operators of affected units that fail to achieve such limitations to request an alternate emission limitation. (2) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish alternate limitations if the Administrator determines that the owner or operator has properly installed and operated continuous emissions monitoring system and control technology designed to achieve such limitations and is unable to achieve such limitations. And (3) the Administrator, after granting alternate limitations, to impose more stringent emissions limitations in subsequent years. Makes such alternate limitations effective January 1, 2015.

FINDINGS.\n\n    Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Research has shown that medicare beneficiaries who are \n        in need of home health services that are covered under the \n        medicare program generally fall into 1 of the 4 following \n        categories:\n                    (A) Post-hospital, short-stay beneficiaries.\n                    (B) Medically stable, long-stay beneficiaries.\n                    (C) Medically complex, long-stay beneficiaries.\n                    (D) Medically unstable and complex, extremely high-\n                use beneficiaries.\n            (2) The interim payment system for home health services \n        under the medicare program, enacted as part of the Balanced \n        Budget Act of 1997 and amended by title V of the Tax and Trade \n        Relief Extension Act of 1998 (contained in Division J of Public \n        Law 105-277), is having the following unintended consequences:\n                    (A) The sickest, most frail medicare beneficiaries \n                are losing access to medically necessary home health \n                services that are otherwise covered under the medicare \n                program.\n                    (B) Many high quality, cost-effective home health \n                agencies have had per beneficiary limits under the \n                interim payment system set so low that such agencies \n                are finding it impossible to continue to provide home \n                health services under the medicare program.\n                    (C) Many home health agencies are being subjected \n                to aggregate per beneficiary limits under the interim \n                payment system that do not accurately reflect the \n                current patient mix of such agencies, thereby making it \n                impossible for such agencies to compete with similarly \n                situated home health agencies.\n                    (D) Medicare beneficiaries that reside in certain \n                States and regions of the country have far less access \n                to home health services under the medicare program than \n                individuals who have identical medical conditions but \n                reside in other States or regions of the country.\n                    (E) The health status of home health beneficiaries \n                varies significantly in different regions of the \n                country, creating differing needs for home health \n                services.\n\nSEC. 3.

Under current law, a state must exclude from Medicaid participation any provider that has been terminated under any state's Medicaid program or under Medicare. The bill maintains those requirements and further requires a state to exclude from Medicaid participation any provider that has been terminated under CHIP. Furthermore, a state must exclude from CHIP participation any provider that has been terminated under Medicaid or Medicare. The bill also revises a state's reporting requirements with respect to terminating a provider under a state plan. A state shall require each Medicaid or CHIP provider, whether the provider participates on a fee-for-service (FFS) basis or within the network of a managed care organization (MCO), to enroll with the state by providing specified identifying information. When notifying the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that a provider has been terminated under a state plan, the state must submit this information as well as information regarding the termination date and reason. HHS shall review such termination notifications and, if appropriate, include them in a database or similar system, as specified by the bill. The bill prohibits federal payment under a state's Medicaid or CHIP program for services provided by an MCO unless: (1) thenbsp. State has a system for notifying MCOs when a provider is terminated under Medicaid, Medicare, or CHIP. And (2) any contract between the state plan and an MCO provides that such providers be excluded from participation in the MCO provider network.","title":"Ensuring Removal of Terminated Providers from Medicaidand CHIP Act","text_len":14366,"sum_len":1856}

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) Legitimate Internet sellers of prescription drugs can \n        offer substantial benefits to consumers. These potential \n        benefits include convenience, privacy, valuable information, \n        competitive prices, and personalized services.\n            (2) Unlawful Internet sellers of prescription drugs may \n        dispense inappropriate, contaminated, counterfeit, or subpotent \n        prescription drugs that could put at risk the health and safety \n        of consumers.\n            (3) Unlawful Internet sellers have exposed consumers to \n        significant health risks by knowingly filling invalid \n        prescriptions, such as prescriptions based solely on an online \n        questionnaire, or by dispensing prescription drugs without any \n        prescription.\n            (4) The ease with which web sites can be created and \n        removed and the lack of readily available information to \n        identify Internet sellers creates significant barriers to \n        effective law enforcement efforts against unlawful Internet \n        sellers.\n            (5) Consumers may have difficulty distinguishing legitimate \n        from unlawful Internet sellers, as well as foreign from \n        domestic Internet sellers, of prescription drugs.\n            (6) States need additional enforcement tools to take \n        effective action against unlawful domestic Internet sellers and \n        the Federal agencies need additional enforcement tools to take \n        effective action against unlawful foreign Internet sellers.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide Federal and \nState law enforcement with adequate tools to take effective action \nagainst interstate Internet sellers of prescription drugs who illegally \nsell such drugs to consumers in the United States and to protect such \nconsumers against potential harms that may result from purchasing such \ndrugs from such sellers.\n\nSEC. 3.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n            (1) manufactured housing plays a vital role in providing \n        housing for low- and moderate-income families in the United \n        States;\n            (2) the FHA title I insurance program for manufactured home \n        loans traditionally has been a major provider of mortgage \n        insurance for home-only transactions;\n            (3) the manufactured housing market is in the midst of a \n        prolonged downturn which has resulted in a severe contraction \n        of traditional sources of private lending for manufactured home \n        purchases;\n            (4) during past downturns the FHA title I insurance program \n        for manufactured homes has filled the lending void by providing \n        stability until the private markets could recover;\n            (5) in 1992, during the manufactured housing industry's \n        last major recession, over 30,000 manufactured home loans were \n        insured under title I;\n            (6) in 2006, fewer than 1,500 manufactured housing loans \n        were insured under title I;\n            (7) the loan limits for title I manufactured housing loans \n        have not been adjusted for inflation since 1992; and\n            (8) these problems with the title I program have resulted \n        in an atrophied market for manufactured housing loans, leaving \n        American families who have the most difficulty achieving \n        homeownership without adequate financing options for home-only \n        manufactured home purchases.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to provide adequate funding for FHA-insured \n        manufactured housing loans for low- and moderate-income \n        homebuyers during all economic cycles in the manufactured \n        housing industry;\n            (2) to modernize the FHA title I insurance program for \n        manufactured housing loans to enhance participation by Ginnie \n        Mae and the private lending markets; and\n            (3) to adjust the low loan limits for title I manufactured \n        home loan insurance to reflect the increase in costs since such \n        limits were last increased in 1992 and to index the limits to \n        inflation.\n\nSEC. 3.

FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds that--\n            (1) excessive securities litigation is a serious burden on \n        the national economy, diverting limited capital resources to \n        less productive areas;\n            (2) meritless lawsuits filed under Federal securities laws \n        are making it harder for American companies to raise capital \n        and attract experienced members to serve on their boards;\n            (3) in the past 3 years, issuers of 1 out of every 12 \n        stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange have been sued for \n        securities fraud;\n            (4) in the securities fraud area, the civil justice system \n        is being transformed into a nonmerit-based, unjust system, in \n        which professional plaintiffs extract settlements from \n        entrepreneurs, regardless of the merits of the cases filed;\n            (5) such securities lawsuits impose additional costs on \n        publicly traded companies, often force them into bankruptcy, \n        and create job losses within the economy;\n            (6) such securities fraud lawsuits stifle the development \n        of future products by compelling investment bankers and \n        accounting firms, whose assistance is essential for accessing \n        capital markets, to resist working with new venture firms \n        because of the higher risk of litigation associated with them; \n        and\n            (7) reform in the securities fraud laws are needed to \n        ensure that the courts can properly hear and adjudicate \n        securities fraud cases.\n\nSEC. 3. PRIVATE CIVIL ACTION PROCEDURES.\n\n    The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is amended by inserting after \nsection 20A (15 U.S.C. 78u-1) the following new section:\n\n                   ``private civil action procedures\n\n    ``Sec. 20B. (a) Requirement of Proportionate Liability.--\n            ``(1) Limitation on joint and several liability.--A \n        defendant who is found liable for damages in an implied private \n        action arising under a provision of this Act may be liable \n        jointly and severally only if the trier of fact specifically \n        determines that the defendant engaged in knowing securities \n        fraud, as defined in paragraph (3).\n            ``(2) Determination of liability.--If the trier of fact \n        does not find, pursuant to paragraph (1), that the defendant \n        engaged in knowing securities fraud, the defendant's liability \n        shall be determined as follows:\n                    ``(A) The trier of fact shall determine the \n                percentage of responsibility of the plaintiff, of each \n                of the defendants and of each of the other persons or \n                entities alleged by the parties to have caused or \n                contributed to the harm alleged by the plaintiff. In \n                determining the percentages of responsibility, the \n                trier of fact shall consider both the nature of the \n                conduct of each person and the nature and extent of the \n                causal relationship between that conduct and the damage \n                claimed by the plaintiff.\n                    ``(B) For each defendant, the trier of fact shall \n                then multiply the defendant's percentage of \n                responsibility by the total amount of damage suffered \n                by the plaintiff that was caused in whole or in part by \n                that defendant and shall enter a verdict or judgment \n                against the defendant in that amount.

Prohibits finding a new device substantially equivalent to a predicate device if the predicate has been removed from the market by the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) or determined to be misbranded or adulterated by judicial order. Permits the FDA to reject a claim of substantial equivalency for a device whose predicate has been corrected or removed from the market by its sponsor. Requires the Secretary to maintain an up-to-date database for purposes of determining whether devices are eligible for use as a predicate device. Requires each manufacturer's corrective action or removal of device report to contain the root cause of each defect leading to the corrective action or removal. Requires a manufacturer's report for devices in the same lineage as devices that have been subject to corrections or removals and requires such report to explain why the subsequent device does not share the flaws of its predecessor device. Requires the Secretary to conduct a review of all covered devices to identify any such devices with respect to which a predicate device, or any device in the full device lineage, has been corrected or removed from the market pursuant to a Class I or Class II recall.","title":"To amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to ensure that a medical device is not marketed based on a determination that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device that has been recalled, corrected, or removed from the market because of an intrinsic flaw in technology or design that adversely affects safety, and for other purposes.","text_len":12378,"sum_len":1653}

Title II: Restricting Juvenile Access to Certain Firearms - Revises the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act to expand the scope of provisions regarding juvenile use and possession of handguns and ammunition that is suitable for use only in a handgun to include semiautomatic assault weapons. Provides enhanced penalties for juveniles who violate the prohibition against the sale, delivery, or other transfer to a person, who the transferor knows or has reasonable cause to believe is a juvenile, of a handgun, ammunition that is suitable for use only in a handgun, or a semiautomatic assault weapon, and for adults who knowingly violate such prohibition, particularly in relation to use of the handgun by the juvenile in the commission of a violent felony. Subjects the juvenile to the same laws, rules, and proceedings regarding sentencing that would be applicable in the case of an adult, with exceptions. Prohibits a juvenile sentenced to a term of imprisonment from being released from custody simply because the juvenile reaches age 18. Makes an exemption regarding the temporary transfer of a handgun, ammunition, or semiautomatic assault weapon to, or possession or use by, a juvenile applicable only if such possession and use are in accordance with State and local law and if specified conditions are met. Specifies that a handgun, ammunition, or semiautomatic assault weapon, the possession of which is transferred to a juvenile in circumstances in which the transferor is not in violation of this title, shall not be subject to permanent confiscation by the Government if its possession by the juvenile subsequently becomes unlawful because of the juvenile's conduct.

Provides that if all offers made by a party with respect to a claim, including any motion to dismiss all claims, are not accepted and the judgment, verdict, or order finally issued in the action under this Act is not more favorable to the offeree than the last such offer: (1) the offeror may file with the court a petition for payment of costs and expenses, including attorney fees, incurred with respect to the claim from the date the last offer from the offeror or from the offeree was made. And (2) the court, if it makes such a finding, shall order the offeree to pay the offeror's costs and expenses unless it finds that requiring the payment of such costs and expenses would be manifestly unjust. Specifies that such an attorney's fee shall be a reasonable fee attributable to the claim, calculated on the basis of an hourly rate which may not exceed that which the court considers acceptable in the community in which the attorney practices law, taking into account the attorney's qualifications and experience and the complexity of the case, subject to specified limitations. Amends rule 702 of the Federal Rules of Evidence to provide that: (1) testimony in the form of an opinion by a witness that is based on scientific knowledge shall be inadmissible in evidence unless the court determines that such opinion is scientifically valid and reliable, has a valid scientific connection to the fact it is offered to prove, and is sufficiently reliable so that the probative value of such evidence is not outweighed by the dangers of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence. And (2) testimony by a witness who is qualified is inadmissible in evidence if the witness is entitled to receive any compensation contingent on the legal disposition of any claim with respect to which the testimony is offered. Amends rule 11(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to require the court to impose sanctions upon the attorneys, law firms, or parties that violate provisions regarding certain representations to the court . Specifies that a sanction imposed for a violation of this rule: (1) shall be sufficient to deter repetition of such conduct or comparable conduct by others similarly situated and to compensate the parties that were injured by such conduct. And (2) may consist of an order to pay to the other party the amount of the reasonable expenses incurred as a direct result of the filing of the pleading, motion, or other paper that is the subject of the violation, including a reasonable attorney's fee. Repeals provisions making rule 11 inapplicable to discovery.","title":"Attorney Accountability Act of 1995","text_len":7844,"sum_len":4134}

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) The California Seamounts and Ridges National Marine \n        Conservation Area established by this Act contains a series of \n        ancient volcanos and underwater geological features in the \n        Exclusive Economic Zone.\n            (2) Found on the seamounts, ridges, and banks in the \n        Conservation Area are rare deep-water corals, sponges, \n        anemones, tunas, sharks, seabirds, marine mammals (including \n        orcas, sperm whales, and blue whales), endangered sea turtles, \n        octopuses, and diverse fish populations, some of which are \n        endemic to the area.\n            (3) The only hydrothermal vents in the continental \n        Exclusive Economic Zone are found on Gorda Ridge located off \n        the north coast of California and the south coast of Oregon.\n            (4) These areas' remote location and depth contribute to \n        their remarkably pristine condition, limited human footprint, \n        and reputation as a vital frontier for scientific discovery, \n        with research expeditions continuing to yield new and rare \n        species, greater understanding about ecological relationships, \n        and renewed appreciation of the uniqueness of deep-sea \n        ecosystems.\n            (5) Despite currently limited direct pressure from \n        extractive use, the Conservation Area is undergoing rapid \n        change due to warming waters, ocean acidification, and \n        ecological stress from pollution and other sources the \n        management of which transcends the jurisdiction of any single \n        government agency or department.\n            (6) According to many scientists, comprehensive marine \n        habitat protection is one of the most important actions for \n        building resilience in ocean environments to current and \n        emerging challenges presented by anthropogenic and other \n        stressors impacting marine ecosystems.\n    (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to protect, conserve, and \nenhance for the benefit and enjoyment of present and future generations \nthe nationally significant historical, natural, cultural, scientific, \nand educational values of the California Seamounts and Ridges National \nMarine Conservation Area.\n\nSEC. 3.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n            (1) An estimated 2,000,000 dogs and cats are slaughtered \n        and sold annually as part of the international fur trade. \n        Internationally, dog and cat fur is used in a wide variety of \n        products, including fur coats and jackets, fur-trimmed \n        garments, hats, gloves, decorative accessories, stuffed \n        animals, and other toys.\n            (2) As demonstrated by forensic tests, dog and cat fur \n        products are being imported into the United States, in some \n        cases with deceptive labeling to conceal the use of dog or cat \n        fur.\n            (3) Dog and cat fur, when dyed, is not easily \n        distinguishable to persons who are not experts from other furs \n        such as fox, rabbit, coyote, wolf, and mink. Dog and cat fur is \n        generally less expensive than other types of fur and may be \n        used as a substitute for more expensive types of furs.\n            (4) Foreign fur producers use dogs and cats bred for their \n        fur, and also use strays and stolen pets.\n            (5) The methods of housing, transporting, and slaughtering \n        dogs and cats for fur production are generally unregulated and \n        inhumane.\n    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n            (1) to prohibit the sale, manufacture, offer for sale, \n        transportation, and distribution in the United States of dog \n        and cat fur products;\n            (2) to require accurate labeling of fur species so that \n        consumers in the United States can make informed choices; and\n            (3) to prohibit the trade in, both imports and exports of, \n        dog and cat fur products, to ensure that the United States \n        market does not encourage the slaughter of dogs or cats for \n        their fur, and to ensure that the purposes of this Act are not \n        undermined.\n\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n    In this Act:\n            (1) Dog fur.--The term ``dog fur'' means the pelt or skin \n        of any animal of the species canis familiaris.\n            (2) Cat fur.--The term ``cat fur'' means the pelt or skin \n        of any animal of the species felis catus.\n            (3) United states.--The term ``United States'' means the \n        customs territory of the United States, as defined in general \n        note 2 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States.\n            (4) Commerce.--The term ``commerce'' means transportation \n        for sale, trade, or use between any State, territory, or \n        possession of the United States, or the District of Columbia, \n        and any place outside thereof.\n            (5) Dog or cat fur product.--The term ``dog or cat fur \n        product'' means any item of merchandise which consists, or is \n        composed in whole or in part, of any dog fur, cat fur, or both.\n            (6) Person.--The term ``person'' includes any individual, \n        partnership, corporation, association, organization, business \n        trust, government entity, or other entity.\n            (7) Interested party.--The term ``interested party'' means \n        any person having a contractual, financial, humane, or other \n        interest.\n            (8) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n        of the Treasury.\n            (9) Duly authorized officer.--The term ``duly authorized \n        officer'' means any United States Customs officer, any agent of \n        the Federal Bureau of Investigation, or any agent or other \n        person authorized by law or designated by the Secretary to \n        enforce the provisions of this Act.\n\nSEC. 4.

FINDINGS.\n\n    The Congress finds the following:\n            (1) Hurricanes, tropical storms, tornadoes, and \n        thunderstorms can cause significant loss of life, injury, \n        destruction of property, and economic and social disruption. \n        All States and regions are vulnerable to these hazards.\n            (2) The United States currently sustains several billion \n        dollars in economic damages each year due to these windstorms. \n        In recent decades, rapid development and population growth in \n        high-risk areas has greatly increased overall vulnerability to \n        windstorms.\n            (3) Improved windstorm impact reduction measures have the \n        potential to reduce these losses through--\n                    (A) cost-effective and affordable design and \n                construction methods and practices;\n                    (B) effective mitigation programs at the local, \n                State, and national level;\n                    (C) improved data collection and analysis and \n                impact prediction methodologies;\n                    (D) engineering research on improving new \n                structures and retrofitting existing ones to better \n                withstand windstorms, atmospheric-related research to \n                better understand the behavior and impact of windstorms \n                on the built environment, and subsequent application of \n                those research results; and\n                    (E) public education and outreach.\n            (4) There is an appropriate role for the Federal Government \n        in supporting windstorm impact reduction. An effective Federal \n        program in windstorm impact reduction will require interagency \n        coordination, and input from individuals, academia, the private \n        sector, and other interested non-Federal entities.\n\nSEC. 3.

Requires the President to revise the National Contingency Plan and the regulations concerning the National Response System to take into account: (1) the adequacy of the Plan to respond to the volume, source, and duration of the discharge caused by the explosion involving the mobile offshore drilling unit Deepwater Horizon. (2) any findings and options related to the Plan made by the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling. And (3) the estimate of the worst case discharges. Requires the President to revise the Plan whenever the estimate of the worst case discharges materially changes. Requires Area Contingency Plans to be adequate to mitigate or remove a worst case discharge. Sets forth provisions concerning revision and presidential review of: (1) Area Contingency Plans. And (2) tank vessel, nontank vessel, and facility response plans to discharges of oil or hazardous substances. Repeals provisions authorizing the President to permit a vessel or facility to operate without an approved response plan if the owner or operator certifies the availability of private personnel and equipment to respond to a worst case discharge or substantial threat of such a discharge. Directs the President to require owners or operators of vessels or facilities that are required to submit response plans to demonstrate annually their capacity to implement such plans. Requires a dispersant schedule prepared under the National Contingency Plan to include specified information regarding the safety and efficacy of the dispersants, other chemicals, and other spill mitigating devices and substances. Prohibits the President from placing such a substance on such schedule unless the President receives satisfactory assurances that the manufacturer will publicly disclose the ingredients of any such substance that will be used to carry out a National Contingency Plan, Area Contingency Plan, or vessel or facility response plan in response to a discharge declared to be a spill of national significance.

UNREASONABLY EXCESSIVE DRUG PRICING.\n\n    (a) In General.--\n            (1) Authority.--The President may issue an Executive order \n        declaring a market shortage for a period of 6 months with \n        regard to one or more vital drugs due to a market shortage \n        under this Act.\n            (2) Unlawful act.--If the President issues an Executive \n        order under paragraph (1), it shall be unlawful for any person \n        to sell vital drugs at a price that is unreasonably excessive \n        and indicates that the seller is taking unfair advantage of the \n        circumstances related to a market shortage to unreasonably \n        increase prices during such period.\n    (b) Authority.--The Attorney General is authorized to enforce \npenalties under this Act.\n\nSEC. 5. ENFORCEMENT.\n\n    (a) Enforcement.--\n            (1) In general.--Whoever sells, or offers to sell, any \n        vital drug during a declared market shortage with the knowledge \n        and intent to charge a price that is unreasonably excessive \n        under the circumstances shall be guilty of an offense under \n        this section and subject to injunction and penalties as \n        provided in paragraphs (2) and (3).\n            (2) Action in district court for injunction.--Whenever it \n        shall appear to the Attorney General that any person is engaged \n        in or about to engage in acts or practices constituting a \n        violation of any provision of this section and until such \n        complaint is dismissed by the Attorney General or set aside by \n        a court on review, the Attorney General may in his or her \n        discretion bring an action in the proper district court of the \n        United States, the United States District Court for the \n        District of Columbia, or the United States courts of any \n        territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the \n        United States to enjoin such acts or practices, and upon a \n        proper showing a permanent or temporary injunction or \n        restraining order shall be granted without bond in the interest \n        of the public.\n            (3) Criminal penalties.--Any person acting with the \n        knowledge and intent to charge a price that is unreasonably \n        excessive under the circumstances shall be guilty of an offense \n        under this section and title 18, United States Code, and \n        subject to imprisonment for a term not to exceed 3 years, fined \n        an amount not to exceed $5,000,000, or both.\n    (b) Enforcement.--The criminal penalty provided by subsection (a) \nmay be imposed only pursuant to a criminal action brought by the \nAttorney General or other officer of the Department of Justice.\n    (c) Multiple Offenses.--In assessing the penalty provided by \nsubsection (a) each day of a continuing violation shall be considered a \nseparate violation.\n    (d) Application.--\n            (1) In general.--This section shall apply--\n                    (A) in the geographical area where the vital drug \n                market shortage has been declared; and\n                    (B) to all wholesalers and distributors in the \n                chain of distribution.\n            (2) Inapplicable.--This section shall not apply to a \n        hospital (as defined in section 1861(e) of the Social Security \n        Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(e)) or a physician (as defined in section \n        1861(q) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(q)).\n\nSEC. 6. DETERMINATION OF UNREASONABLY EXCESSIVE.\n\n    (a) In General.--The Attorney General, in determining whether an \nalleged violator's price was unreasonably excessive, shall consider \nwhether--\n            (1) the price reasonably reflected additional costs, not \n        within the control of that person or company, that were paid, \n        incurred, or reasonably anticipated by that person or company;\n            (2) the price reasonably reflected additional risks taken \n        by that person or company to produce, distribute, obtain, or \n        sell such product under the circumstances;\n            (3) there is a gross disparity between the challenged price \n        and the price at which the same or similar goods were readily \n        available in the same region and during the same Presidentially \n        declared market shortage;\n            (4) the marginal benefit received by the wholesaler or \n        distributor is significantly changed in comparison with \n        marginal earnings in the year before a market shortage was \n        declared;\n            (5) the price charged was comparable to the price at which \n        the goods were generally available in the trade area if the \n        wholesaler or distributor did not sell or offer to sell the \n        prescription drug in question prior to the time a market \n        shortage was declared; and\n            (6) the price was substantially attributable to local, \n        regional, national, or international market conditions.\n    (b) Consultation.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \nenactment of this Act and annually thereafter, the Attorney General or \ndesignee, shall consult with representatives of the National \nAssociation of Wholesalers, Group Purchasing Organizations, \nPharmaceutical Distributors, Hospitals, Manufacturers, patients, and \nother interested community organizations to reassess the criteria set \nforth in subsection (a) in determining unreasonably excessive and \nprepare and submit to Congress a report on the results of the \nreassessment.\n\nSEC. 7. DURATION.\n\n    (a) In General.--Any market shortage declared by the President in \naccordance with this Act shall be in effect for a period of not to \nexceed 6 months from the date on which the President issues the \nExecutive order.\n    (b) Termination.--Any market shortage declared by the President in \naccordance with this Act shall terminate if--\n            (1) there is enacted a law terminating the market shortage \n        which shall be passed by Congress after a national market \n        shortage is declared; or\n            (2) the President issues a proclamation terminating the \n        market shortage;\nwhichever comes first.\n    (c) Declaration Renewal.--The President may renew the state of \nmarket shortage declared under subsection (a), if the President \ndeclares that the severe shortage continues to affect the health and \nwell being of citizens beyond the initial 6-month period.","summary":"Protecting Patients and Hospitals From Price Gouging Act - Authorizes the President to issue an executive order declaring a market shortage for six months with regard to one or more vital drugs if the total supply of all clinically interchangeable versions of a drug regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is inadequate to meet the current or projected demand at the user level. Defines a vital drug as any drug or biologic used to prevent or treat a serious or life-threatening disease or medical condition, for which there is no other available source with sufficient supply available. Makes it unlawful, when the President issues such an executive order, for any person to sell vital drugs at a price that: (1) is unreasonably excessive, and (2) indicates that the seller is taking unfair advantage of the circumstances related to a market shortage to increase prices unreasonably during that period. Gives the Attorney General authority to enforce penalties under this Act. Makes any person who sells, or offers to sell, any vital drug during a declared market shortage with the knowledge and intent to charge a price unreasonably excessive under the circumstances guilty of an offense and subject to injunction and penalties. Applies such sanctions, except to a hospital or a physician, in the geographical area where the vital drug market shortage has been declared and to all wholesalers and distributors in the chain of distribution. Sets forth factors for the Attorney General to consider in determining whether an alleged violator's price was unreasonably excessive. Makes a declaration under this Act terminate if: (1) there is enacted a law terminating the market shortage after a national market shortage is declared, or (2) the President issues a proclamation terminating the declaration. Authorizes the President to renew such a market shortage declaration if the severe shortage continues to affect the health and well-being of citizens beyond the initial six-month period.","title":"A bill to prohibit prescription drug price-gouging during states of market shortage.","text_len":9172,"sum_len":2002}

The summary of that version is repeated here. Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act of 2016 This bill amends the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to revise and reauthorize the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Great Lakes Restoration Initiative for FY2017-FY2021. The bill restates the initiative's priorities for Great Lakes protection and restoration programs and projects, including: (1) the remediation of toxic substances and areas of concern. (2) the prevention and control of invasive species and their impacts. (3) the protection and restoration of near-shore health and the prevention and mitigation of nonpoint source pollution, (4) habitat and wildlife protection and restoration. And (5) accountability, monitoring, evaluation, communication, and partnership activities. In selecting the best combination of the initiative's programs and projects, the EPA must consult with the Great Lake states and Indian Tribes and solicit input from other non-federal stakeholders. The EPA must designate a point person from an appropriate federal partner to coordinate, with federal partners and non-federal stakeholders, the initiative's projects and activities involving harmful algal blooms in the Great Lakes. In addition to current requirements concerning the use of funds made available to carry out the initiative, the bill requires initiative funds to be used to strategically implement operations and activities of EPA's Great Lakes National Program Office, such as remediation of sediment contamination in areas of concern. The EPA or federal department or agency that receives funds under the initiative may make a grant to, or enter into an agreement with, a qualified nonfederal entity for planning, researching, monitoring, outreach, or implementation of a project that supports the Initiative Action Plan or the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. Projects may be carried out under the initiative on multiple levels, including at the local level. Funding made available to implement the initiative may not be used for any water infrastructure activity for which funding is made available under the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 2014. The EPA must review, and revise, if appropriate, the Initiative Action Plan at least once every five years. The EPA must also: (1) establish a process for monitoring and periodically reporting to the public on the plan's progress, (2) make information about each project carried out under the plan available on a public website, and (3) provide to specified congressional committees a yearly detailed description of the initiative's progress and amounts transferred to participating federal departments and agencies for carrying out activities that support the initiative.","title":"Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act of 2016","text_len":13422,"sum_len":2841}
